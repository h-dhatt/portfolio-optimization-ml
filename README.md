# Portfolio Optimization with Machine Learning

This project applies **modern portfolio theory** and machine learning techniques to optimize risk–return tradeoffs in asset allocation. It demonstrates how quantitative methods can guide investment strategies.

## Methods
- Implemented classic approaches:
  - Mean–Variance Optimization (Markowitz)
  - Efficient Frontier construction
- Incorporated regularization and shrinkage estimators for covariance matrices
- Explored extensions with clustering and machine learning for asset grouping
- Backtested strategies on historical financial data

## Results
- Machine learning–based covariance estimators improved stability of optimized portfolios.
- Efficient frontier plots illustrate clear tradeoffs between risk and return.
- Backtests showed more consistent performance versus naive equal-weighted allocation.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Sample datasets
